# The Maze Project üë®‚Äçüéì 


This project is a first person `3D` maze game. Similar to Wolfenstein or Doom, minus enemies and weapons, although they may be added later. It was made using `SDL2` and `C`. It runs on Mac OS X and Linux/Ubuntu. The game uses the technique raycasting to create the apparent `3D` nature of the maze. The Maze is a 3D Maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world! 

The Maze was written  in C using `SDL2` library. Deveploment was performed using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4

### About SDL2 üíª
Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.

## Requirements to Play
- Mac OS X or Linux/Ubuntu
- SDL2

If you don't have SDL2 installed download the installation script <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/graphics_programming/install_SDL2.sh">here</a>. Then find the script and run it in your terminal:
```groovy
$ ls
install_SDL2.sh
$ chmod 755 install_SDL2.sh
$ sudo ./install_SDL2.sh
